  <h1>Welcome to the unofficial Ricochet manual.</h1>

  <section class="section-content">
    <h2 class="section-header">What is Ricochet?</h2>
    <p>
      Ricochet is a Goldsrc engine game where you hop around on platforms via
      jump pads and hit people off of them with your discs.<br />
      It's very simple in concept, but there's a few complexities which make the
      game much more exciting.<br />
      This manual intends to teach you as much as it can about Ricochet and its gameplay.<br
      /><br />
      <img src="note.gif" width="31" height="11" alt="note" /> This guide is written
      implying you know the basics of playing a Goldsrc game.

    <h2 class="section-header">The Controls</h2>
    <img src="options.png" width="427" height="182" alt="Controls" />
    <p>
      Ricochet is an average first-person Goldsrc game, using WASD and left
      click and right click.<br />
      However, there are two important things to keep in mind:<br />
      <b>1. THERE IS NO JUMP KEY.<br />2. TURN ON RAW MOUSE INPUT.</b><br />
      The first is a mistake a lot of newbies make, and the second has the game literally
      not function without it.<br />
      Once you know those, you should be good to go.<br /><br />
      All your jumping is done on the various jump arrows that reside throughout
      the map. You can airstrafe to make more slick movements, but that's out of
      the scope of this guide.
    </p>

      <img src="tips.jpg" width="31" height="11" alt="Tip" />
      <p>
        If you want to get to a pad that's farther down, hold the forward and a
        singular strafe key and walk at it at an angle.

    <h2 class="section-header">The Gameplay</h2>
    <img src="gameplay.png" alt="Gameplay" />
    <p>
      If you came into this expecting a rooty tooty point n' shooty, you thought
      wrong.<br />
      The gameplay is quite different, but also easy to understand in general.<br
      /><br />
      Your goal is to kill the other players by either pushing them off the edge
      with your <b>left-click</b> discs or decapitating them with your
      <b>right-click</b>
      discs.<br />
      You get a point for a direct hit kill with a push disc, and also one with a
      decapitation disc.<br /><br />
      <img src="tips.jpg" width="31" height="11" alt="Tip" />
      Decap discs fire every frame. Make use of this info if you ever find yourself
      in a situation where you can throw out multiple.<br />

      >Left: Killing with a regular disc. Right: Killing with a decap disc.</small
    ><br /><br />
    The real bread and butter of point gaining are <b>ricochets</b>.<br />
    If you bounce a disc off of a wall and kill a player with it, you get two points.<br
    />
    A disc can bounce for a maximum of three times before it returns to you.<br
    />
    You can get up to <b>5 points per kill</b> (maximum, no more).<br />
    You can have a maximum of three discs at play, and using a decap disc will use
    up all three.

    <p>
      There are two official gamemodes in this game; <b
        >Arena and Free-For-All.</b
      ><br /><br />
      <b>Arena</b> is a one-on-one arena fighting experience. First one to get
      three points wins, and the loser gets booted out.<br /><br />
      <b>Free-For-All</b> is what you expectâ€”bounce around in a larger map and try
      to get as many points as possible. It usually doesn't have a frag count.
    </p>
    <div class="tips">
      <img src="tips.jpg" width="31" height="11" alt="Tip" />
      <p>
        Arena is where Ricochet is most competitive. If you want to get better,
        try that mode.

    <h2 class="section-header">The Discs and The Powerups</h2>
    <img src="discs.png" alt="Discs" />
    <p>
      You can see your discs at the top of the screen. When they glow, they are
      ready to become decap discs.<br />
      You can also collect <b>Powerups</b> which are scattered throughout the
      map and spawn frequently.<br />
      There are four types of powerups:
    </p>

    <h3>Power Discs</h3>
    <img src="powerdiscs.png" alt="Power Discs" />
    <p>
      Power Discs are collected by touching the red spiral. They allow your
      discs to decapitate when close and knock back hard when far.<br />
      <img src="tips.jpg" width="31" height="11" alt="Tip" /> Getting this powerup
      will automatically refill your discs.
    </p>

    <h3>Fast Discs</h3>
    <img src="fastdiscs.png" alt="Fast Discs" />
    <p>
      Fast Discs are collected by touching the green circles. They allow you to
      shoot speedy discs.<br />
      <img src="tips.jpg" width="31" height="11" alt="Tip" /> Getting this powerup
      will give you nine discs.
    </p>

    <h3>Triple Discs</h3>
    <img src="triplediscs.png" alt="Triple Discs" />
    <p>
      Triple Discs shoot three discs instead of one. They help you cover more
      ground.<br />
      <img src="tips.jpg" width="31" height="11" alt="Tip" /> Getting this powerup
      will automatically refill your discs.
    </p>

    <h3>Freeze Discs</h3>
    <img src="freezediscs.png" alt="Freeze Discs" />
    <p>
      Freeze Discs slow down anyone hit by them to a crawl. They can be very
      useful for making kills easier.<br />
      <img src="tips.jpg" width="31" height="11" alt="Tip" /> Getting this powerup
      will automatically refill your discs.
